# Chinese Poker (十三支)

This project is a c++ implementation of a traditional Chiense Poker Game (十三支).
It was designed as the semester project of Computer Programming course for [NTU](http://www.ntu.edu.tw/) students in 2016-2018.

The realtionship between each class is illustrated as the following figure.

In each weekly coding session, I instructed the students in implementing this project step by step.
